# McDonaldsMenu

A simple application that allow uses to make an order. User can add or delete products to their order by inputing a numbers for example, 1 for Big Mac etc.
User can see cost of products and total cost after adding new product. Their order is updated after adding and removing products.
It was made as I was practising Composition and Polymorphism in Java.
